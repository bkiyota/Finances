# Finances

The files in this repository will predominately span reports and analyses that attempt to look at spending habits, 
their underlying trends, or other underappreciated patterns in a comprehensive manner. All of them were done for fun, and have
given me a great opporunity to test out new ways to visualize or present information pertaining to my everyday finances. 

Currently, and for the forseeable future, the reports are made using RMarkdown.
